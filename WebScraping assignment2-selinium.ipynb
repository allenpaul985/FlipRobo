Basically I searched for a phone with a Great Camera and Video Quality for Making YouTube Videos My Budget was around 40-50k then I search a lot on the Internet. Then I finally decide to buy this phone. I've been using this phone for about a week and I purchased this phone at 45K and I'm really happy with that. Its Software Integration with Processor is Just Awesome! This phone can easily beat any Android Smartphone which comes with a flagship-grade processor. I thought its display is not too good then its upper iPhones but I was wrong Its display is so Bright and Buttery Smooth. Its video quality is beyond my expectations. If you want to see the Unboxing of My iPhone 11 then you can see it on my YouTube Channel \"Vishwas Kaushik\" I really Happy with this product from Apple at this Price Thanks Flipkart.</td>\n",

I can’t wait to see what the next future phones will be like. The screen display on this bad boy are unbelievable they are so clear and never fail me. The performance is super cool there is a lot of cool features as well I like this phone because I feel that it is easy to use and one of my favorite things about this phone is the Face ID!! It is just remarkable and easy to get into my phone instead of doing the whole password which sometimes takes ages!! Overall I think this is the best phone yet to be built!! I used to have a really old phone like the iPhone 6s which is a big step up. This iPhone 6s wasn’t the best at taking pictures</td>\n",

       "4   So far it’s been an AMAZING experience coming back to iOS after nearly a decade but it’s not as versatile as android though phone is sturdy dropped it accidentally a couple of times and nothing happened fortunately camera is awesome                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "95  Awesome camera, smooth and fast UI, display is great (though not LED) but the black area at the top could have been reduced. Battery remains a day even if used heavily. Charger in the box is ok, but 12 or 18W could have been nothing like anything. Overall an excellent product and comfortable to use. I have got it almost a month back and so far so good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "97  I write this review after using a week this iPhone 11.\\nI'm 6 Years Old Android User and this is my first iPhone. Basically I searched for a phone with a Great Camera and Video Quality for Making YouTube Videos My Budget was around 40-50k then I search a lot on the Internet. Then I finally decide to buy this phone. I've been using this phone for about a week and I purchased this phone at 45K and I'm really happy with that. Its Software Integration with Processor is Just Awesome! This phone can easily beat any Android Smartphone which comes with a flagship-grade processor. I thought its display is not too good then its upper iPhones but I was wrong Its display is so Bright and Buttery Smooth. Its video quality is beyond my expectations. If you want to see the Unboxing of My iPhone 11 then you can see it on my YouTube Channel \"Vishwas Kaushik\" I really Happy with this product from Apple at this Price Thanks Flipkart.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "98  Everything is perfect pictures come out so clearly and at first I wasn’t sure when I got it then when I started to use it and get the hang of it it was amazing!! I can’t wait to see what the next future phones will be like. The screen display on this bad boy are unbelievable they are so clear and never fail me. The performance is super cool there is a lot of cool features as well I like this phone because I feel that it is easy to use and one of my favorite things about this phone is the Face ID!! It is just remarkable and easy to get into my phone instead of doing the whole password which sometimes takes ages!! Overall I think this is the best phone yet to be built!! I used to have a really old phone like the iPhone 6s which is a big step up. This iPhone 6s wasn’t the best at taking pictures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

I’m am very happy with the camera picture quality, Amazing face id unlocked in dark room, Strong battery with perfect screen size as you can carry easily in pocket. This is my third iPhone.  I shifted from android Samsung Note series to iPhone because of the strong build quality and peace of mind for next 3-4 years.  Don’t think to much just go for it and I suggest you to go for minimum 128gb variant or more 256gb.

The delivery was on time and I came in good packaging 2. First impression were awesome the display is not as bad as it is written in the spec list it’s the high quality LCD Panel that you will get in any phone and using dark made/light mode will not make any difference since it’s an LCD panel 3. Cameras were excellent even in the night 5? I have also uploaded some sample images 4. Performance mind blowing Apple A13 chip is super fast everything is buttery smooth 5. Battery 3110 mah and the optimisation of Apple and IOS 13 you will get good battery life and you will not get fast charger out of box you have to buy this separately  The final thing I wanna say is if you are on a budget of 60-70 go for the iPhone 11 and If you have enough money go for the iPhone 11 Pro Max don’t buy the iPhone 11 Pro (My opinion) Or you can get iPhone 11 and Apple Watch series 5 with same price of 11 pro The phone is great you will not regret after buying it go for it ??</td>\n",

       "2   Amazing Powerful and Durable Gadget.  I’m am very happy with the camera picture quality, Amazing face id unlocked in dark room, Strong battery with perfect screen size as you can carry easily in pocket. This is my third iPhone.  I shifted from android Samsung Note series to iPhone because of the strong build quality and peace of mind for next 3-4 years.  Don’t think to much just go for it and I suggest you to go for minimum 128gb variant or more 256gb.  I’ve attached my puppy pics and no filter used just in day light capture and see the quality for comparison.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "3   Previously I was using one plus 3t it was a great phone And then I decided to upgrade I am stuck between Samsung s10 plus or iPhone 11 I have seen the specs and everything were good except the display it’s somewhere between 720-1080 and it’s not even an amoled it’s an LCD display But I decided to go with iPhone because I have never used an IOS device I have Been an android user from the past 9 years I ordered IPhone 11 (128gb) product red My experience after using 3 weeks 1. The delivery was on time and I came in good packaging 2. First impression were awesome the display is not as bad as it is written in the spec list it’s the high quality LCD Panel that you will get in any phone and using dark made/light mode will not make any difference since it’s an LCD panel 3. Cameras were excellent even in the night 5? I have also uploaded some sample images 4. Performance mind blowing Apple A13 chip is super fast everything is buttery smooth 5. Battery 3110 mah and the optimisation of Apple and IOS 13 you will get good battery life and you will not get fast charger out of box you have to buy this separately  The final thing I wanna say is if you are on a budget of 60-70 go for the iPhone 11 and If you have enough money go for the iPhone 11 Pro Max don’t buy the iPhone 11 Pro (My opinion) Or you can get iPhone 11 and Apple Watch series 5 with same price of 11 pro The phone is great you will not regret after buying it go for it ??\n",

       "95  Well , as we all know if its not an Iphone , its not an iphone . The iphones are always beast . The camera game has been level up . The A13 Bionic is just fabulous . The update this year are certainly the camera which is damn good with d addition of wide angle lens as well as ultra wide . If anyones purchasing an iphone for the first time , do opt for the black color . Its just feels more than premium . Battery life is damn good with lasting fully a day . Overall a nice package .

I shifted from android Samsung Note series to iPhone because of the strong build quality and peace of mind for next 3-4 years.  Don’t think to much just go for it and I suggest you to go for minimum 128gb variant or more 256gb.

The delivery was on time and I came in good packaging 2. First impression were awesome the display is not as bad as it is written in the spec list it’s the high quality LCD Panel that you will get in any phone and using dark made/light mode will not make any difference since it’s an LCD panel 3. Cameras were excellent even in the night 5? I have also uploaded some sample images 4. Performance mind blowing Apple A13 chip is super fast everything is buttery smooth 5. Battery 3110 mah and the optimisation of Apple and IOS 13 you will get good battery life and you will not get fast charger out of box you have to buy this separately  The final thing I wanna say is if you are on a budget of 60-70 go for the iPhone 11 and If you have enough money go for the iPhone 11 Pro Max don’t buy the iPhone 11 Pro (My opinion) Or you can get iPhone 11 and Apple Watch series 5 with same price of 11 pro The phone is great you will not regret after buying it go for it ??</td>\n",

       "2   Amazing Powerful and Durable Gadget.  I’m am very happy with the camera picture quality, Amazing face id unlocked in dark room, Strong battery with perfect screen size as you can carry easily in pocket. This is my third iPhone.  I shifted from android Samsung Note series to iPhone because of the strong build quality and peace of mind for next 3-4 years.  Don’t think to much just go for it and I suggest you to go for minimum 128gb variant or more 256gb.  I’ve attached my puppy pics and no filter used just in day light capture and see the quality for comparison.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "3   Previously I was using one plus 3t it was a great phone And then I decided to upgrade I am stuck between Samsung s10 plus or iPhone 11 I have seen the specs and everything were good except the display it’s somewhere between 720-1080 and it’s not even an amoled it’s an LCD display But I decided to go with iPhone because I have never used an IOS device I have Been an android user from the past 9 years I ordered IPhone 11 (128gb) product red My experience after using 3 weeks 1. The delivery was on time and I came in good packaging 2. First impression were awesome the display is not as bad as it is written in the spec list it’s the high quality LCD Panel that you will get in any phone and using dark made/light mode will not make any difference since it’s an LCD panel 3. Cameras were excellent even in the night 5? I have also uploaded some sample images 4. Performance mind blowing Apple A13 chip is super fast everything is buttery smooth 5. Battery 3110 mah and the optimisation of Apple and IOS 13 you will get good battery life and you will not get fast charger out of box you have to buy this separately  The final thing I wanna say is if you are on a budget of 60-70 go for the iPhone 11 and If you have enough money go for the iPhone 11 Pro Max don’t buy the iPhone 11 Pro (My opinion) Or you can get iPhone 11 and Apple Watch series 5 with same price of 11 pro The phone is great you will not regret after buying it go for it ??  \n",
       "4   So far it’s been an AMAZING experience coming back to iOS after nearly a decade but it’s not as versatile as android though phone is sturdy dropped it accidentally a couple of times and nothing happened fortunately camera is awesome                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "95  Well , as we all know if its not an Iphone , its not an iphone . The iphones are always beast . The camera game has been level up . The A13 Bionic is just fabulous . The update this year are certainly the camera which is damn good with d addition of wide angle lens as well as ultra wide . If anyones purchasing an iphone for the first time , do opt for the black color . Its just feels more than premium . Battery life is damn good with lasting fully a day . Overall a nice package . Well managed and timely delivery by flipkart always .
